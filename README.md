Styling & Animations

Caching Recommendations
Images and badges are referenced via URLs or local assets in /src/assets.

For production, consider optimizing images (e.g., WebP format) and using CDN caching.

Use service workers (via tools like Workbox or Vite PWA plugin) to cache static assets for offline support.

Avoid inline SVG or JSX in constants files if using static bundlers or caching layers, to prevent parsing issues. Use imports or React components instead.

Deployment
Build the project for production:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
Deploy the contents of the dist folder to your hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.).
